# Hello, world!

This is a basic hello world application written in go.  It prints the following string literal to stdout: "Hello, world".

This took me 1 year to write.  During this time I spent in hiding, I haven't seen my wife and kids.  Learning go is too important - the fate of the world rests upon my fingertips' ability to write go code.
